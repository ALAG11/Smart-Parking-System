# 🚗 Smart Parking System

Welcome to the **Smart Parking System**! This project leverages the power of Arduino Uno and ultrasonic sensors to create an automated, efficient, and smart parking solution.

## 🌟 Features

- **Automated Parking**: Automatically detects available parking spots.
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Uses ultrasonic sensors for precise vehicle detection.
- **User-Friendly**: Simple setup and easy-to-use interface.
- **Scalable**: Can be expanded to support multiple parking spots.

## 🛠️ Hardware Requirements

- **Arduino Uno**: The brain of our smart parking system.
- **Ultrasonic Sensors**: For accurate distance measurement.
- **Breadboard and Jumper Wires**: For circuit connections.
- **LEDs**: To indicate parking spot availability.

## 📑 How It Works

1. **Setup**: Connect the ultrasonic sensors and LEDs to the Arduino Uno.
2. **Detection**: Ultrasonic sensors detect the presence of a vehicle and measure the distance.
3. **Indicator**: LEDs indicate whether a parking spot is available or occupied.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/ALAG11/Smart-Parking-System.git
    ```
2. **Upload the Code**: Open the provided `.ino` file in the Arduino IDE and upload it to your Arduino Uno.
3. **Assemble the Hardware**: Follow the wiring diagram to connect your sensors and LEDs.
